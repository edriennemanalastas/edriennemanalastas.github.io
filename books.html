				<h1>That Feeling When...</h1>
				<p><img id="blogPhoto" src="Images\book.jpg" width="400" align="left"></img>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Before Christmas break, I visited Deloitte to see some of my friends at 5:30PM (it's too early for them to go home). My reason for coming was to drop off some gifts, but little did I know they had something for me as well!
				<br> <br>
				&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When I saw the book, I was both excited (cause look at that beautiful orange cover) and scared (because looking at the title, I know I gotta change). I still haven't finished it, but so far, it has helped me lots! I went from not swimming at all during the fall semester to swimming AT LEAST 2x a week! I know, it's not much. I'm currently working on increasing that to 3!

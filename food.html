				<h1>Come to Sushi Bar Zipang With the Gang </h1>
				<p><img id="blogPhoto" src="Images\sushi.jpg" width="500" align="left"></img>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When I checked this place out, I did not know what to expect. This was recommended to me by a foodie co-worker (who I now trust because of this), and I'm glad I came!
				<br> <br>
				&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My friend and I ordered a sashimi plate and some sushi. Their sashimi was AMAZING. I usually don't like non-salmon sashimi, but theirs did not have much of the fish taste (well... of course, sushi (i.e raw fish) is supposed to taste like fish. I meant the bad smell people usually hate). Although it was a bit pricey (for my poor student wallet), I think it was worth it.

				<h1>Bubble Mania finally has what I've been waiting for</h1>
				<p><img id="blogPhoto" src="Images\avobbt.jpg" width="500" align="left"></img>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When it comes to bubble tea in Calgary, I only trust two places: Chatime and Bubble Mania. I usually go to Bubble Mania when I'm craving wings AND bubble tea. Chatime only recently started focusing on good food, so I don't trust them as much on that part yet. 
				<br> <br>
				&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I went there to catch up with my friend, Rey. The ambiance was really good and the waitress was very kind to us. Of course, their Garlic Parmesan wings was Gucci (as always).

				<b>WOW</b><sup>*</sup>: Bubble mania has cheap wings Monday-Thursday
